# create-awesome-package


When you need to create a new package, need to add a lot of boilerplate code, webpack or other build system to transpile to ES5 etc.

`create-awesome-package` helps to create the package with build system and necessary stuff.

You just write your own code ðŸ”¥

# How to install

`npm i -g create-awesome-package`

<h1>How to use</h1>

Go to your root of the package you want to build.

Then, Just run

`create-awesome-package coolio`



OR also you can use `npx`

`npx create-awesome-package coolio` ( if you don't want to globally install it)

and you are done!

It will provide you the boilerplate you need to get started!
