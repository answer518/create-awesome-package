# create-awesome-package


When you need to create a new package, need to add a lot of boilerplate code, webpack or other build system to transpile to ES5 etc.

This CLI helps to create the package with JS/TS, build system(Webpack/Parcel) and necessary stuff ðŸ”¥
It's like create-react-app but for building packages ðŸ“¦


`create-awesome-package` helps to create the package with build system and necessary stuff.

### You can create package with JavaScript/TypeScript

You just write your own code ðŸ”¥

# How to install

`npm i -g create-awesome-package`

<h1>How to use</h1>

Go to your root of the package you want to build.

Then, Just run

`create-awesome-package [name]`

example -
`create-awesome-package my-package`

OR also you can use `npx`

`npx create-awesome-package my-package` ( if you don't want to globally install it)

and you are done!

It will provide you the boilerplate you need to get started!
